# PurchaseRequestSystem-Web
Capstone Project for 2017 Spring Java Bootcamp

The objective of this project was to create an intranet site that an employee can use to purchase items. It allows for user 
registration, purchase requests to be submitted, manager approval of purchase requests, and searching of products and vendors. 
The project utilizes Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JSP/Servlets.

Eclipse Neon and MySQL Workbench 6.3 were used. Available files include the Java src files as well as two SQL script files for 
database formation, including the addition of products and vendors.
